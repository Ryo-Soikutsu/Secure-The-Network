# Secure The Network
Our IDuccS have picked up some suspicious network traffic originating from one of our internal web servers. We believe that it has been compromised by Shroom agents, but are lacking the manpower to analyze the suspected traffic capture. Can you take a look at the network capture and figure out what's going on?
